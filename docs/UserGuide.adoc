[TIP]
KPI refers to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator[Key Performance Index].

[TIP]
KPI scores should be a number from 0 - 5.

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0). Priorities, high(2) or medium(1), can be added after the tag.

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 r/Secretary k/4.99 d/John is forgetful t/friends t/owesMoney 2`

Format: `list` or `list t/TAG` or `list k/KPI`

* `t/TAG` flag can be specified with a tag to list _all persons belonging to that tag_. +

* `k/KPI` flag can be specified with a KPI value to list _all persons with that value_. +

* If no flags are specified, _all persons_ are listed by default.

Example:

You can input  to display all persons with that tag in your address book.

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/POSITION] [k/KPI] [d/NOTE] [t/TAG [PRIORITY]]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* Use `all/` instead of `INDEX` to edit all persons listed in a single command.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* You can remove the person's position or KPI by typing `r/` or `k/` respectively without specifying any position or KPI.
****

// tag::search[]
=== Finding persons by attribute : `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find PREFIX KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is not case sensitive.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* You can search by name, email, address, key performance index, position, phone number and tags
* Partial words or words with typos will be matched too eg. 'Hangs' will be matched to 'Hans'
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* Only one tag at a time can be searched, eg. `find t/helloWorld` will find tags cotaining `helloWorld` and `find t/helloWorld t/world` will find tags containing `world`. *`find` will only register the last tag entered*.
****


Examples:

* `find a/jurong west ave` +

==== Search guessing
This feature will also display actual *Keywords matched* and *Keywords guessed* to give you a good indicator of which results were guessed.

image::find_feature1.png[width="250"]


From the above results we can see that `Bernicc` yields `Keywords guessed: {Bernice}` whereas `Alex` yields `Keywords matched: {Alex}`


Examples:

* `find p/9123` +
Displays any person having the phone number similar to `9123` eg. `91231231`, `91231234`, and so on.

TIP: To narrow down your searches, try to be more specific in the phone number you wish to search for.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Locks addressbook and clears all data.
* `password helloworld` +
Unlocks addressbook and restores all data.
=======
Locks address book with a password string and clears all data.

=== Text prediction

Text prediction feature allows you to complete your command faster with less typing. +
Invoke this feature by pressing the _Tab_ key on the keyboard. +

You can invoke this feature on _most_ command keywords and arguments: +

* Command keywords (`mail`, `add`, `find`, etc.) .
* Flag arguments (`n/`, `a/`, `t/`, etc.) .

For example, given an address book consisting of a contact with the name _Alex Yeoh_: +
Typing `m` in the box and pressing _Tab_ will auto complete to the `mail` command. Then, typing `mail n/A` and pressing _Tab_ will auto complete to `mail n/Alex Yeoh` for you. +

****
* This feature does not work with some flag arguments when used with certain commands. +
E.g. `add n/...` +
If text prediction returns no predictions, it means text prediction is unsupported in that context.
* If there are multiple predicted values, they will be listed down. +
* If no argument flags are specified, the default value predicted is based on the command's default argument. +
****

*Q*: Oh no! I accidentally deleted an extremely important contact! How do i retrieve old information? +
*A*: There are two ways in which you can retrieve old information. +
Firstly, there is the undo/redo function in which you can undo a command. +
Secondly, with the all new backup/restore feature, you can backup your address book at any time and restore it to that state whenever you want!.

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Now with the export/import function, you can export your old contacts into a CSV file and move the file to the new computer so you can import contacts from it. (Remember to download CorpPro on the other computer though!)

*Q*: What happens if I forget my password? +
*A*: Your Address book will not be recoverable. You will have to delete addressbook.xml.encrypted and choose a backup to restore from.

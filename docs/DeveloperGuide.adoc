By: `W12-3`      Since: `AUG 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Stores a `UniqueTagList` hashmap in the `Address Book`. Each unique `Tag` key is assigned to a value of the list of `person` who are assigned with the same tag.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Data Encryption
==== Current Implementation

The encrypt/ decrypt mechanism is facilitated by `FileEncryptor`.
It extends `AddressBook` with a encrypt/decrypt feature, maintained by `PasswordCommand`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FileEncryptor#process()` -- Decrypts or encrypts the data file depending on its current state (encrypted or decrypted).
* `VersionedAddressBook#decryptFile()` -- encrypts a file given the path and password.
* `VersionedAddressBook#encryptFile()` -- decrypts a file given the path and password.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the password mechanism behaves at each step.


*Step 1.* The user enters the password command with a password.

[NOTE]
If the user enters a password which is non alpha-numeric, an error will be thrown at the CommandResult box. Only alpha-numeric passwords are supported by `FileEncryptor`

*Step 2.* The user closes the address book.

*Step 3.* The user re-opens the address book. No data will be shown as the `XML data file` is technically not present in the data folder.

*Step 4.* The user enters the password command with the right password. Address book will be refreshed and restored back to its former state (before encryption).

[NOTE]
If the user enters the wrong password , an error will be thrown at the CommandResult box.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How encryption and decryption is done
1. The `PBEKeySpec` is first specified using the "PBEWithMD5AndDES" specification.
2. A secret key is generated from `SecretKeyFactory` using "PBEWithMD5AndDES" cipher.
3. A `Cipher` is then used to encrypt or decrypt the file with a given password and key specifications.
4. Additional salt is used in the password to ensure that the password cannot be easily broken down by dictionary attacks.

===== Aspect: Pros and cons of tight security
** Pros: Your data is protected and it will be near impossible to use any third part tool to crack the data file.
** Cons: Data will be *permanently* lost if you forget the password.

====== Encrypting the address book:

*Step 1.* The user executes `password test` to encrypt the address book with `test` as the password. +

*Step 2.* `PasswordCommandParser` checks for the validity of the input password (if its alpha-numeric) +

*Step 3.* If the password is acceptable, it is parsed to the `PasswordCommand` object +

*Step 4.* Within the `PasswordCommand` object, a new `FileEncryptor` object is created and it will check *if* the address book is currently in a locked state +

*Step 5.* If it is not currently locked, it will create a cipher and begin encrypting the address book with the input password. +

*Step 6.* Previous `addressbook.xml` will be deleted whereas a new `addressbook.xml.encrypted` file will be created. +

*Step 7.* A new `emptyPredicate` object will be instantiated and `model.updateFilteredPersonList(emptyPredicate)` will be called to clear the address book list. +

*Step 8.* A `CommandResult` object will be created to notify the user that the encryption was successful +


====== Accessing commands post encryption:

*Step 1.* The user executes `list` to list out all the contacts in the address book. +

*Step 2.* The user input is parsed by `AddressBookParser` which creates a new `ListCommandParser` object. +

*Step 3.* The arguments are then parsed by the `ListCommandParser`. +

*Step 4.* `ListCommandParser` then checks the validity of the arguments before it creates the `ListCommand` object. +

*Step 5.* `ListCommand` creates a `FileEncryptor` object to check if the address book is in a locked state by calling the `islocked()` method. +

*Step 6.* isLocked() will return true. +

*Step 7.* A `CommandException` will be thrown to warn the user that the address book is in a locked state.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Text prediction

The low level implementation of text prediction is done in `Trie`. The internal data structure is a _Tree_ structure where each character is stored as a node and strings built into a single tree.

A node has a `endNode` flag that determines if that node represents the last character of the predicted string value. If such a node is reached, the entire string value is appended to the prediction list.

The data structure can be visualised in the diagram below:

image::text_prediction_general.png[width="800"]

In addition, `Trie` implements the following main operations:

* `Trie#insert(String value)` -- inserts a string into the data structure.
* `Trie#remove(String value)` -- removes a string from the data structure.
* `Trie#getPredictList(String prefix)` -- retrieve a list of predicted string values that completes the prefix.

The prediction implementation is achieved by utilising depth first search (DFS) in the data structure, starting from the node representing the last character of the prefix.

The prediction algorithm is illustrated with the help of the following diagram:

image::text_prediction_predict.png[width="800"]

For example, we call the method `getPredictList("wom")`.

The algorithm works by first traversing the route (green circles) that represents `"wom"` and stopping at the `m` node (red circle). The algorithm procedes to DFS from that node and explore all it's children nodes (blue circles).

Hence, calling `getPredictList("wom")` will return a list containing the elements:

* `"en"`
* `"ble"`

// tag::backuprestore[]
=== Back Up and Restore
==== Back Up
Creation of backups is done in `BackUpCommand` class. It extends the `Command` class with an overriding execute function. +
The execute function does the following operations: +
Step 1. The `BackUpCommand` class will check if a `.backup` directory exist. If it does not, a `.backup` will be created. +
Step 2. The `backUpAddressbook()` method will be called on the current model. +
Step 3. The `ModelManager` will read the current address book into a `ReadOnlyAddressbook` +
Step 4. A `XmlAddressBookStorage` will be initialised with the path of `.backup` and the file name. The file name will be that of the time in milliseconds since epoch (1970). +
Step 5. A new `.xml` file will be saved in the path by invoking `saveAddressBook()` on the `ReadOnlyAddessbook` created. +

==== Listing of backup snapshots
Listing of the snapshots of backups is done with the `RestoreSnapshotsCommand` class. It also extends the `Command` class. +
The execute function does the following operations: +
Step 1. Checks the `.backup` folder for all the snapshots and stores them in a `BackupList` class. Throws an exception if `.backup` does not exist or is empty. +
Step 2. Converts the names of file into the format DATE TIME and saves it in an array. +
Step 3. Iterate through the array and form a string to print. +
Step 4. Prints the string. +

The `BackupList` object holds a map of files with indexes as its keys. It also has an array of `String`. The position of the strings corresponds to the index of the file it represents in the map. +

==== Restoring from the list
The restoration of backup snapshots is done in the `RestoreCommand` class. It extends the `Command` class with an overriding execute function. +
The execute method will do the following operation: +
Step 1. `BackupList` and an `INDEX` input by the user. +
Step 2. The `BackupList` contains a map of `File` with an `INDEX` attached to it. +
Step 3. The chosen file based on the index will be converted in to a path and the current data in the address book will be replaced by the chosen file.

// TODO: Add design considerations and sequence diagram

// end::backuprestore[]

// tag::exportimport[]
=== Export and Import
==== Export to CSV
The export function is facilitated by the `ExportCommand` class. It extends the `Command` class wit an overriding execute function. +
The execute method will do the following operation: +
Step 1. The current address book information will be instantiated into a new `ReadOnlyAddressbook` object. +
Step 2. An `ObservableList<Person>` will be obtained from the address book. +
Step 3. The `ObservableList<Person>` will be written onto a CSV file via the CsvWriter object. +

`CsvWriter` is an object that takes in a path of where the export is to be saved and write a CSV file into the said path. +
The conversion is as follows: +
Step 1. The constructor converts an `ObservableList<Person>` into a `List<Person>`
Step 2. The `convertToCsv()` method will be called in `ExportCommand` and a new CSV file will be written with the content of the created `List<Person>`. +
Step 3. This file will be created in the path. +

=== Import CSV to address book
The import function is implemented with the `ImportCommand` class. It extends the `Command` class with an overriding execute method. +
The execute method will fo the following operation: +
Step 1. A `CsvReader` will be instantiated with the file corresponding to the path of CSV file provided by the user. +
Step 2. The `CsvReader` will call the `convertToList` method which returns a `List<Person>`. +
Step 3. It will then iterate through the `List<Person>` and add `Person` one by one into the `Model`. If there are any duplicates it will be skipped. +

`CsvReader` is an object that takes in a CSV file and converts it into a  list of persons. +
The conversion is as follows: +
Step 1. The constructor reads a CSV file line by line. +
Step 2. The `convertToList` method formats the file into a `Model` friendly format. +
Step 3. It then converts the strings into a persons. +
Step 4. These persons are then stored in a `List<Person>` and returned. +

// TODO: add design considerations and sequence diagram

// end::exportimport[]

// tag::search[]
=== Find and Search
==== Current Implementation

The find function has been revamped to support search guessing and search by attributes. +
`FindCommand` is now backed up by the `ClosestMatchList` class which uses `LevenshteinDistanceUtil` and `HammingDistanceUtil` to generate an ordered set of `Person` attributes ordered by similarity.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How find command executes
* **Alternative 1:** Find using only predicates
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Search must be exact, cannot have typos or incomplete keywords
* **Alternative 2:** Store the search results in a `treeMap` ordered by their Levenshtein or Hamming distances from the search keyword
** Pros: Will also consider searches that are similar to what we want and will account for typos or incomplete keywords
** Cons: Added complexities in finding and searching, can be vague when searching for number attributes
* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Same as alternative 2 but we use *Hamming distance* for phone numbers and KPI attributes instead.
** Pros: Phone number and KPI searches are now more precise
** Cons: Added complexities in finding and searching

===== Aspect: Expanded features of find command
* **Alternative 1:** Find only by name
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Can only search by name of addressees

* **Alternative 2:** Find by attributes
** Pros: Can search by email, phone, address, etc instead of just the name of addressees
** Cons: Can only search for one attribute at a time (i.e find by name or find by email)

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Chain-able find attributes
** Pros: Can search by email and phone and address, etc instead of just one at a time
** Cons: Added complexities in find command

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the revamped Find command
`treeMap` was used to store the search results ordered by their Levenshtein or Hamming distances. +
The results are then filtered and
results furthest away from the top few are ignored. The searches will then be passed thru their respective predicates
(`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `KpiContainsKeywordPredicate`, `NoteContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `PhoneContainsKeywordPredicate`, `PositionContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`)
before filtering the list.

====== Searching for a contact:

*Step 1.* The user executes `find a/Clementi t/owesMoney` to find all contacts staying in Clementi and bearing the `owesMoney` tag. +

*Step 2.* The user input is parsed by `AddressBookParser` which creates a new `FindCommandParser` object. +

*Step 3.* The arguments `a/Clementi t/owesMoney` are then parsed by the `FindCommandParser`. +

*Step 4.* `FindCommandParser` then checks the validity of the arguments before it creates the `FindCommand` object. +

*Step 5.* `FindCommand` then proceeds to create `ClosestMatchList` objects. +

*Step 6.* It uses the list of keywords obtained from `ClosestMatchList` to create `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`. +

*Step 7.* These predicates are combined into a `combinedPredicate` object using the "AND" operation. +

*Step 8.* The model is then updated by calling `model.updateFilteredPersonList(combinedPredicate)` together with the combined predicate obtained in *Step 8.* +

*Step 9.* A `CommandResult` object will be created and an internal method `findActualMatches()` will be called to generate a string of keywords that are exact matches and keywords that are guessed. +

// end::search[]

// tag::schedule[]
=== Schedule
==== Current implementation
Updating the *Schedule* is facilitated by the `ScheduleCommand` class which extends the `Command` class.
`ScheduleAddCommand`, `ScheduleEditCommand` and `ScheduleDeleteCommand` further extends `ScheduleCommand` to add, edit and
delete entries in the *Schedule* respectively.

===== Activity
Each entry in the *Schedule* is an `Activity`. It consists of a `String` which takes the name of the activity
and the `Date`, of which the activity is due.

===== Schedule
`Schedule` is implemented with a `TreeMap`. It has the `Date` of activities as its `key` and a `list` of activities, which is due on the same
date, as its `value`.

Additionally, it implements the following main operations:

* `Schedule#add()` -- Add an `Activity` to `schedule`. +
* `Schedule#delete()` -- Deletes an `Activity` from `schedule`. +
* `Schedule#setSchedule` -- Sets `schedule` from a `list` of activities. This operation is executed when importing data from an `XML` file.
 This happens when you first start *CorpPro*.
* `Schedule#getSchedule()` -- Returns the schedule with activities sorted by `Date` to be displayed in the GUI by `SchedulePanel` in the `UI` component.

The schedule is instantiated in the `AddressBook` and have the main operations exposed in the `Model` interface as follows:

* `Model#addActivity()` -- Exposes `Schedule#add()` .
* `Model#deleteActivity()` -- Exposes `Schedule#delete()`.
* `Model#updateActivity()` -- This operation edits an `Activity` in `schedule` by first executing `Schedule#delete()`, followed
by `Schedule#add()`.
* `Model#getSchedule()` -- Exposes `Schedule#getSchedule()`.

===== Storage
In addition to the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functions, the schedule is also saved to an `XML` file
whenever you update it. This is facilitated by `XmlAdaptedActivity` which stores an `Activity` in an `XML` format.
`XmlSerializableAddressBook` then appends each `XmlAdaptedActivity` into a list and is saved in `addressbook.xml`.

===== Usage scenarios
Given below are examples of usage scenarios of how the schedule behaves when you carry out `schedule` commands. +

====== Adding an activity:
*Step 1.* The user executes `schedule-add d/01/01/2018 a/Complete report.` to add an activity to their schedule. +

*Step 2.* The user input is first parsed by `AddressBookParser` which creates a new `ScheduleAddCommandParser` object. +

*Step 3.* The arguments, `d/01/01/2018 a/Complete report.`, are then parsed by `ScheduleAddCommandParser`. +

*Step 4.* `ScheduleAddCommandParser` checks the validity of the date and activity as input by the user. It then creates an
`Activity` object. +

[NOTE]
If the date or the activity name is not valid, an error would be returned to the user instead of creating an `Activity` object.

*Step 5.* `ScheduleAddCommandParser` then creates a new `ScheduleAddCommand` with the `activity` as its argument. +

*Step 6.* `ScheduleAddCommand` is executed and calls `Model#addActivity()` which creates the `activity` in the `schedule`.

[NOTE]
Before calling `Model#addActivity()`, the address book is checked if it is encrypted with a password, via `FileEncryptor`.
It the address book is locked, an error would be displayed to the user instead of carrying on with the command.

*Step 7.* `indicateAddressBookChanged()` is called within `Model#addActivity()` to raise an `AddressBookChangedEvent`, that the information within the
address book is changed.  +

*Step 8.* The `UI` object, `schedulePanel` which is subscribed to the event, receives this updated information and updates
the display to show the correct information to the user. +

The following sequence diagrams shows you how the add operation works: +

Figure 1. Interactions inside the Logic component for the `schedule-add d/01/01/2018 a/Complete report.` command.
[NOTE]
The figure above illustrates the sequence from *Step 1.* to *Step 5.* +

Figure 2. Interactions inside the Storage component for the `schedule-add d/01/01/2018 a/Complete report.` command
[NOTE]
The figure above illustrates the sequence of *Step 6.* and *Step 7.* +

image::scheduleAddSequenceDiagramEvent.png[width="700"]
Figure 3. Interactions between the `EventCenter`, `UI` and `Storage` components for the `schedule-add d/01/01/2018 a/Complete report.` command
[NOTE]
The figure above illustrates the sequence of *Step 8.* +

[NOTE]
Storage of each activity is facilitated by `XmlAdaptedActivity` which stores an `Activity` in an `XML` format. `XmlSerializableAddressBook` then appends each `XmlAdaptedActivity` into a list and is saved in `addressbook.xml`

====== Editing an activity:
*Step 1.* The user executes `schedule-edit 2 a/Interview intern.` to edit an activity at `INDEX 2` in their schedule. +

*Step 2.* The user input is first parsed by `AddressBookParser` which creates a new `ScheduleEditCommandParser` object. +

*Step 3.* The arguments, `2 a/Interview intern.`, are then parsed by `ScheduleEditCommandParser`. +

*Step 4.* `ScheduleEditCommandParser` checks the validity of the index and activity as input by the user. +

*Step 5.* `ScheduleEditCommandParser` then creates a new `ScheduleEditCommand` with the `INDEX` and the activity
 `String` as its argument. +

*Step 6.* `ScheduleEditCommand` checks if the `INDEX` given is valid (within the size of the listed schedule) and calls
`Model#updateActivity()`

[NOTE]
If the activity name or index is not valid, i.e. out of range, an error would be returned to the user instead of editing
an activity.

[NOTE]
Before calling `Model#updateActivity()`, the address book is checked if it is encrypted with a password, via `FileEncryptor`.
It the address book is locked, an error would be displayed to the user instead of carrying on with the command.

*Step 7.* `Model#updateActivity()` updates the corresponding `activity` in the `schedule`.
`indicateAddressBookChanged()` is called within `Model#updateActivity()` to raise an `AddressBookChangedEvent` that the information within the
address book is changed.  +

*Step 8.* The `UI` object, `schedulePanel` which is subscribed to the event, receives this updated information and
updates the display to show the correct information to the user. +

The following sequence diagrams shows how the edit operation works:

image::scheduleEditSequenceDiagramLogic.png[width="900"]
Figure 4. Interactions inside the Logic component for the `schedule-edit 2 a/Interview intern.` command
[NOTE]
The figure above illustrates the sequence from *Step 1.* to *Step 6.* +

image::scheduleEditSequenceDiagramStorage.png[width="700"]
Figure 5. Interactions inside the Model component for the `schedule-edit 2 a/Interview intern.` command
[NOTE]
The figure above illustrates the sequence of  *Step 7.* +

The interactions between the `EventCenter`, `UI` and `Storage` components for the `schedule-edit 2 a/Interview intern.`
command (*Step 8.*) are similar to *adding an activity* (see *Figure 3.*)

====== Deleting an activity:
*Step 1.* The user executes `schedule-delete 2` to delete the activity at `INDEX 2` in their schedule. +

*Step 2.* The user input is first parsed by `AddressBookParser` which creates a new `ScheduleDeleteCommandParser` object. +

*Step 3.* `ScheduleDeleteCommandParser` checks the validity of the index as input by the user.

*Step 4.* `ScheduleDeleteCommandParser` then creates a new `ScheduleDeleteCommand` with the `INDEX` as its argument. +

*Step 5.* `ScheduleDeleteCommand` checks if the `INDEX` given is valid (within the size of the listed schedule) and calls
`Model#deleteActivity()`

[NOTE]
If the index is not valid, i.e. out of range, an error would be returned to the user instead of deleting
an activity.

[NOTE]
Before calling `Model#deleteActivity()`, the address book is checked if it is encrypted with a password, via `FileEncryptor`.
It the address book is locked, an error would be displayed to the user instead of carrying on with the command.

*Step 6.* `Model#deleteActivity` deletes the corresponding `activity` from the `schedule`. `indicateAddressBookChanged()` is called
within `Model#deleteActivity()` to raise an `AddressBookChangedEvent`, that the information within the
address book is changed.  +

*Step 7.* The `UI` object, `schedulePanel` which is subscribed to the event, receives this updated information and updates
the display to show the correct information to the user. +

The sequence of deleting an activity is similar to editing an activity. Instead of updating the activity, it is deleted. (see *Figure 4.* and *Figure 5.*)

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure of Schedule
* **Alternative 1:** `List` of Activities
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Need to sort each activity by its date whenever the schedule is updated.
** Cons: Larger time complexity.

* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** `TreeMap` of Activities
** Pros: Activities are automatically sorted by their dates whenever the schedule is updated.
** Pros: Faster time complexity.
** Cons: Harder to implement.
** Cons: Larger space complexity.

===== Aspect: Date of Activity
* **Alternative 1:** `String` of date in DD/MM/YYYY format
** Pros: Easy to implement and do not need to parse user input.
** Cons: Need to implement comparators to sort the dates of activity.
** Cons: Not flexible. Unable to include and sort by time in future implementations
* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** Usage of `java.util.Date`
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Pros: Able to sort by time in future implementations.
** Cons: Need to parse `Date` when converting it to `String`.
** Cons: Need to parse user inputs to convert `String` to `Date`.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+

+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== PROJECT: CorproC

---

== Overview

CorpProC is an addressbook application which provides *you* with ease of access and increase in *your* productivity in the workplace. Users can interact with the addressbook using a command line interface and intuitive GUI create with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *encrypt or decrypt the addressbook data*.
** What it does: password allows users to safely encrypt or decrypt the addressbook data using a secure cipher.
** Justification: This feature ensures that you can lock up your addressbook and prevent others from accessing your sensitive information.
** Highlights: This enhancement might affect the execution of other commands in a way that other commands cannot be executed while the addressbook is locked. An additional block of code should be added for future commands to keep with the standards.
** Credits: adapted from Esailija [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13673556/using-password-based-encryption-on-a-file-in-java[Stack overflow]]

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to search by different attributes so that you can hone in on their search results to find the person you are looking for. Search is revamped to utilise Levenshtein distance which is a known algorithm for finding your closest search results based on your keywords.

== PROJECT: CorpPro

---

== Overview
CorpPro is an address book for corporate users. +
It provides a fast and efficient system for corporate users to store their contacts safely and securely. It is also easy to maneuver and access contacts.
CorpPro is powered by JavaFX and boasts an intuitive GUI (Graphical User Interface) with easy-to-use CLI (Command Line Interface). +
This portfolio documents my ability to write java programs, as well as documentation in the form of user and developer guides.

== Summary of contributions

* *Feature 1*: Added the ability for users to secure their addressbook by *encrypting* data.
** What it does: Upon entering the `password` command followed by a password, it will encrypt the addressbook data using `PBEWithMD5AndDES` cipher.
** Justification: This feature was implemented so that corporate users can secure sensitive information in accordance to PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act) rules. Reducing the possibilities of data leaks and unwanted access.
** Highlights: This feature uses a well-known cipher `PBEWithMD5AndDES` and `PBEKeySpec` which accepts the user's password. Once the file is encrypted, it will not be crackable unless done via brute forcing.
It also requires file type checking to make sure that I can compress both encryption and decryption process into one single `password` command much like a toggle so that users need not utilise 2 different commands for encrypting and decrypting.
** Credits: Code snippet adapted from Esailija [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13673556/using-password-based-encryption-on-a-file-in-java[Stack overflow]]

* *Feature 2*: Implemented smart searching for `find` command.
** What it does: Users can now search for the contacts they want by roughly specifying other traits/ attributes of the contacts. For example, users can
search for contacts who live in Jurong West and are tagged as friends.
** Justification: Corporate users might need to gather rough statistics of their clients or know which worker(s) to contact and assign work.
** Highlights: This feature uses Levenshtein and Hamming Distance to find the closest match for the keywords entered. It will then sort the matches based on how close it is to the keywords entered.
After which, it will perform a set intersection on the various contacts to find the contact which meets all the user's search requirements.

* *Feature 3*: Implemented the use of custom preference to specify custom path for addressbook.xml.
** What it does: Users can now specify the path they wish to save their addressbook.xml to.
** Justification: Corporate users might want to have separate addressbooks without the need of storing their application in different folders.
They can instead change the preference file to decide what is the name and location they wish to store the addressbook.xml data file.
** Highlights: This feature requires implementing their json reader in `UserPrefs` class and storing it as a public variable for other classes to depend on.

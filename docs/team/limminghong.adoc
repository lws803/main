== PROJECT: CorpPro

---

== Overview

*CorpPro* is a desktop address book application which targets small to medium corporates to allow their employees to keep track of colleague information in the office.
CorpPro allows users to `add`, `edit` and `tag` with the Command Line Interface (CLI) or the Graphical User Interface (GUI), that is created with JavaFX.
This portfolio contains the contributions I had made towards the improvement of the basic Address Book provided to us. +

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: added *the ability to export and import your contacts.*
** What it does: Allows the user to export contacts to a CSV file to any existing directory. Vice versa, `CSV` files can also be imported from any existing directory and be added to the address book.
** Justification: Enables users to shift between computer systems with ease. +
** Highlights: In order to ensure that the exported file is compatible with other applications. +
Imported files have to be properly parsed to retrieve contacts.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added *the ability to back up and restore your address book.*
** What it does: Allow the user to back up their address book at any point in time. This allows them to revert their address book to any previous state if they wish to.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to retrieve any lost information if they have accidentally deleted any.
** Highlights: Precautionary measures have to be done as saving the folders in a separate directory will result in the database being compromise. Therefore, we have to protect the folder the backups are saved by making the directory unknown.

== PROJECT: CorpPro

---

== Overview

*CorpPro* is a desktop address book application which targets Corporate Users. It helps its users better manage
their information to increase efficiency and to produce effective results. *CorpPro*â€™s features aid users to find relevant
details quickly, in addition to being able to create a schedule to plan and set goals. Users can create and update entries
in *CorpPro* through the command-line interface (CLI), as well as having an uncluttered user interface (UI) to display corresponding
information. It is made using Java, a widely used programming platform.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *additional attributes* to each contact in the address book
** What it does: The following attributes have been added:
     *** Position/rank
     *** Tag priority
     *** Key Performance Index (KPI)
     *** Note/Description
** Justification: As a corporate user with many contacts, there is a need have additional fields and attributes to catagorize or
search for them quickly. Users can use tags to assign an importance level to each contact. The Key Performing Index (KPI)
is also included in the attributes to enable managers or supervisors to rate or rank their employees.
** Highlights: This feature required the creation of additional *application programming interfaces* (API) to facilitate other features
such as listing or finding contacts via these additional attributes.

* *Major enhancement*: *Added schedule*
** What it does: Users are able to create activities or tasks and add them to their schedule in *CorpPro*. These activities
are sorted by date and can be edited or deleted when completed. The schedule is also saved when the user closes the application
** Justification: Corporate users may need to organise their assignments in a schedule to maintain a methodical work style
to increase efficiency and not to neglect any important tasks.
** Highlights: This feature required the creation of additional commands and the implementation of exporting the schedule to save
its contents after the user has exit the application. In addition, a unique data structure had to be used to maintain a sorted schedule (by date).

* *Minor enhancement*: The *add command* automatically parsers the contact's name to capitalize the first letter of each word and remove additional spaces. This is to standardize contacts in the address book for a quick and easy reference.

* *Minor enhancement*: Enhanced the *edit command* to edit all listed entries in one command. This enables users to quickly update contacts, listed by a similar category, all at once, saving time and increasing
efficiency.

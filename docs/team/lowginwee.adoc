== PROJECT: CorpPro

---

== Overview

*CorpPro* is a desktop address book application which targets Corporate Users. It helps its users better manage
their information to increase efficiency and to produce effective results. *CorpPro*â€™s features aid users to find relevant
details quickly, in addition to being able to create a schedule to plan and set goals. Users can create and update entries
in *CorpPro* through the command-line interface(CLI), as well as having an uncluttered user interface(UI) to display corresponding
information. It is made using Java, a widely used programming language, with over 10 thousand lines written.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *additional attributes* to each contact in the address book
** What it does: The following attributes have been added:
     *** Position/rank
     *** Tag priority
     *** Key Performance Index(KPI)
     *** Note/Description
** Justification: As a corporate user with many contacts, there is a need to tag or describe each contact to catagorize or
search them quickly. Users can use tags to assign an importance level to each contact. The Key Performing Index (KPI)
is also included in the attributes to enable managers or supervisors in rate or rank their employees.
** Highlights: This feature affects existing commands and facilitates listing or finding contacts via these additional attributes.

* *Major enhancement*: *Added schedule*
** What it does: Users are able to create activities or tasks and add them to their schedule in *CorpPro*. These activities
are sorted by date and can be edited or deleted when completed. The schedule is also saved when the user closes the application
** Justification: Corporate users may need to organise their assignments in a schedule to maintain a methodical workstyle
to increase efficiency and not to neglect any important tasks.
** Highlights: This feature required the creation of additional commands and the implementation of exporting the schedule to save
its contents after the user has exit the application.In addition, a unique data structure had to be used to maintain a sorted schedule(by date).

* *Minor enhancement*: Enhanced the edit command to edit all listed entries in one command.

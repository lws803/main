# Software development life cycle

- requirements
- analysis
- design
- implementation
- testing

# Sequential models

The sequential model, also called the waterfall model, models software development as a linear process

- When one stage of the process is completed, it should produce some artifacts to be used in the next stage. (Abit similar to a return in a method)

## Pros and cons
- Pros: This could be a useful model when the problem statement that is well-understood and stable.

- Cons: The major problem with this model is that requirements of a real-world project are rarely well-understood at the beginning and **keep changing** over time


## Sequential vs Iterative
- It organises based on activities rather than functionality


# Iterative Models

The iterative model (sometimes called iterative and incremental) advocates having several iterations of SDLC. 
Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirement gathering to testing & deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.

  
  
In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product. Feedback on the version can then be fed to the next iteration.
## The iterative model can take a breadth-first or a depth-first approach to iteration planning.

- breadth-first: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel.
- depth-first: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components.

Note: Most projects use a combination of both and can sometimes be called as 'iterative and incremental approach'

## Pros and cons

- Pros: Will not overshoot deadlines, can adapt better to customer demands, less costly

- Cons: Harder to gauge and monitor progress

## Unified Process

The unified process is developed by the Three Amigos - Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh (the creators of UML). The unified process consists of four phases: inception, elaboration, construction and transition.  

The main purpose of each phase can be summarized as follows:

Note: Unified process is a flexible and customizable process model framework rather than a single fixed process.

## Inception:

- Understand the problem and requirements
- Communicate with customer
- Plan the development effort


## Elaboration:
- Refines and expands requirements
- Determine a high-level design e.g. system architecture

## Construction:
- Major implementation effort to support the use cases identified
- Design models are refined and fleshed out
- Testing of all levels are carried out
- Multiple releases of the system

## Transition:
- Ready the system for actual production use
- Familiarize end users with the system


## CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)

CMMI provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes, which will improve their performance.

  
CMMI defines five maturity levels for a process and provides criteria to determine if the process of an organization is at a certain maturity level.

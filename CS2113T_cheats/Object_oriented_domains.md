# Object oriented domains

A class diagram used to model objects in the problem domain. eg. snakes and ladders, we have objects such as board, snek, player, dice etc etc.  
In this case we do not consider how the code should be like.

## Differences

- OO Domains do not show navigability (the arrow -->)
- OO Domains is about the problem domain not the solution domain

## Similarities
- Both are UML diagrams

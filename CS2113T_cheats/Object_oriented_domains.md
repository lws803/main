# Object oriented domains

A class diagram used to model objects in the problem domain. eg. snakes and ladders, we have objects such as board, snek, player, dice etc etc.  
In this case we do not consider how the code should be like.

## Differences

- OO Domains do not show navigability (the arrow -->, which class knows about which class)
- OO Domains is about the problem domain not the solution domain (eg. we rule out stuff like database, eventsCenter, modelManager classes, facade classes)

## Similarities
- Both are UML diagrams

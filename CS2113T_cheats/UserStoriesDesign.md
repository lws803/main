# Designing User stories

## Non functional requirements

1. reliability - `does not crash when downloading 1000000 PRs at once`
2. availability
3. portability - `Easy to move around data`
4. scalability - `Can accommodate more data, expand to larger user groups`
5. usability
6. maintainability

Some examples of non functional requirements:
- As a user I want to be able to handle up to 1000000 PRs by my students without exceeding 500mb of ram usage.
- System must perform adequately with 100000 users

#### Note: Think of NFRs as constraints placed on the product

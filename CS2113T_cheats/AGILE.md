# AGILE framework

## Key features

1. Requirements are prioritized based on the needs of the user, are clarified regularly (at times almost on a daily basis) with the entire project team, and are factored into the development schedule as appropriate.

2. Instead of doing a very elaborate and detailed design and a project plan for the whole project, the team works based on a rough project plan and a high level design that evolves as the project goes on.

3. Strong emphasis on complete transparency and responsibility sharing among the team members. The team is responsible together for the delivery of the product. Team members are accountable, and regularly and openly share progress with each other and with the user.


## Examples
- eXtreme Programming (XP)
- Scrum

## Scrum

Scrum is a process skeleton that contains sets of practices and predefined roles.

### Roles
1. The Scrum Master, who maintains the processes (typically in lieu of a project manager)
2. The Product Owner, who represents the stakeholders and the business
3. The Team, a cross-functional group who do the actual analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.

### Sprint
- A Scrum project is divided into iterations called Sprints. A sprint is the basic unit of development in Scrum. Sprints tend to last between one week and one month, and are a timeboxed (i.e. restricted to a specific duration) effort of a constant length.

- Each sprint is preceded by a planning meeting, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made, and followed by a review or retrospective meeting, where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified.

- During each sprint, the team creates a potentially deliverable product increment

### Features of Sprint
1. Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members
2. A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need

### Daily scrum

During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

Note: The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting.


## Extreme programming (XP)

**Extreme Programming (XP) stresses customer satisfaction.** Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software **you need as you need it.**


### Features
- XP aims to empower developers to confidently respond to changing customer requirements, even late in the life cycle.

- XP emphasizes teamwork. Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. XP implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes around the problem to solve it as efficiently as possible.

- XP aims to improve a software project in five essential ways: communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage. Extreme Programmers constantly communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their design simple and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. Every small success deepens their respect for the unique contributions of each and every team member. With this foundation, Extreme Programmers are able to courageously respond to changing requirements and technology.

- XP has a set of simple rules. XP is a lot like a jig saw puzzle with many small pieces. Individually the pieces make no sense, but when combined together a complete picture can be seen. This flow chart shows how Extreme Programming's rules work together.
